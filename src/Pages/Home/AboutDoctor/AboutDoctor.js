          <h4>Dr. Edward Eric Jr</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">Oral Surgeon</p>
          <p>
            With over 20 years of clinical experience, Edwardâ€™s practice follows
            the philosophy that therapy is most successful when people are
            treated as whole human beings, not as individual parts, and his work
            is focused on finding and treating the root causes.
